The Tip Calculator is a user-friendly web application designed to calculate the tip amount, total bill, and split it among multiple people based on the service quality. It features a clean interface, responsive design, and dynamic functionality for a seamless user experience.

This project was developed as part of my Web Development Bootcamp.

### Logic Flow

#### Logic Implementation

**Input of Bill Amount and Number of Sharers:**

- Users enter the bill amount in the provided input field (e.g., 47.32).
- Users specify the number of people sharing the bill (default is 1).
- Real-time validation ensures inputs are numeric and greater than zero.

**Service Quality Selection:**

- Users can select from four predefined service levels: ‚òπÔ∏è, üòê, üôÇ, ü§©.
- Buttons dynamically update their state (`aria-selected`) based on user interaction.

**Input Validation:**

- Ensures valid input for bill amount and number of sharers.
- Prompts users for corrections when values are missing or incorrect.

**Calculation:**

- Tip is calculated based on the selected service level (2%, 10%, 15%, or 20% of the bill).
- The total amount is computed by adding the tip to the bill amount.
- The per-person amount is derived by dividing the total by the number of sharers.

**Dynamic Feedback:**

- Results are dynamically displayed in a hidden results section, revealed after calculation.

**Reset Functionality:**

- Clears inputs and resets the interface, including service quality button states.
